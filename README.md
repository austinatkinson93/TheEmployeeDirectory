# TheEmployeeDirectory

Welcome to my Employee Directory application. This is a fairly simple mock application which allows you to view all of the current employees populated by a mock API.

## installation
* Here is the link to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/austinatkinson93/TheEmployeeDirectory)
* Have a look at the [Deployed Application](https://austinatkinson93.github.io/TheEmployeeDirectory/)

## Usage
Simply open the link to the deployed site to view all of the employees.

    - The employees can be searched by name (first or last) 
    - Employees can also be sorted alphabetically by name
